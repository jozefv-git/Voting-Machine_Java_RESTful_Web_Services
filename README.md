## Description
### This is a project for Web Services course conducted by me and 3 of my classmates. This is a voting machine web application created with RESTful Web Services. Visitor of the site can start the quiz, answer, skip question, go back to previous question. In the end he can download a .txt file with all questions and his answers, and go to results page, where he will see 3 best matching candidates. By clicking on a candidate name the visitor will be redirected to the public profile page of the candidate. We have also implemented an account system for interviewers whose credentials were hard-coded in the database, and for candidates, who can create an account only if they have been invited, complete it with personal information and answer the quiz. Interviewers can invite candidates by email and an unique code, delete candidates from the machine, as well as, add, edit and remove questions. I was responsible full-stack for the quiz seen by visitors, including download of the .txt file, also for the page where interviewers manage candidates participating in the machine. I also did a bit of front-end on dashboard page and the page where interviewers manage questions.

## Notes
### All database credentials were deleted for security reasons.
